# Heh-series
So this is a malware series that i like to develop on my free time for fun.


## Information
- I am not the one responciable for any damage, if you run these on your own pc or on one of your friends pc.
- I develop this malware series for fun and science reasons and i do not encourage any kind of harm to any machine.
- If you are going to run these run it on windows 10(probably it works on windows xp-10 but just to be safe)(and i HIGHLY recomend running them on a vm)

### While running
- These malware files are only for windows.
- I do not recomend running these on your pc. I recomend setting up a vm(via. vmware or virtual box or any other virtualiziton service)

## Bug reports
If you find any bug please contact me from discord:Pengu_bro#5950.

### While reporting
Please tell me what version of windows you use and if it is in a vm or not.
NOTE: I know that heh xp and remastered's mouse disabler doesnt work on a vm
